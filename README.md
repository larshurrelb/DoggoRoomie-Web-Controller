Welcome to the DoggoRoomie - Fluffy Tightrope Web Controller repository! This project provides web-based applications designed to control a zoomorphic dog-like robot, developed as part of our study:

	⁠"The Fluffy Tightrope - Examining Zoomorphic Robot Interactions For Promoting Active Behavior In A Comfortable Setting."
> 

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains the necessary tools to manage and control the robot's movement and interactions.

## 🔧 Requirements

•⁠  ⁠[Deno Runtime](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation)

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project consists of two parts:

1.⁠ ⁠*Main Controller App* - Root of this repository, runs locally via localhost
2.⁠ ⁠*Web Deployed Face* - Located in ⁠ /web_deployed_face.zip ⁠, needs to be deployed on the web

Both components use Deno (a modern alternative to NodeJS) as their runtime.

## 🚀 Setup & Usage

### Network Configuration

1.⁠ ⁠Ensure the device running this controller app is connected to the same airlink router (2.4 GHz!) as:
    - The Vacuum Robot (Valetudo)
    - The Microcontroller (Feather ESP8266)
    - The Samsung Tablet
2.⁠ ⁠Configure the IP addresses in ⁠ /public/config.js ⁠ to match the actual IP addresses of devices in your local network

(The current router shows ip addresses of connected devices on its webinterface under http://192.168.1.1/)

### Hardware Setup

1.⁠ ⁠⁠Connect the LiPo battery to the Feather and insert 4 AA batteries into the battery pack
    
    ⚠️ *Don’t reverse the polarity!* The *red wire* of the LiPo battery should be on the *right side* when connecting — the *BAT pin* should be next to it
    
    🔋The LiPo battery discharges quickly → to recharge it, keep it connected to the Feather and plug the Feather into a laptop via micro USB
    
2.⁠ ⁠Ensure all wired connections are secure
3.⁠ ⁠⁠Make sure the robot vacuum is turned on

### Running the Application

1.⁠ ⁠On the tablet, open Chrome and visit the robot dog face website:
    - URL: https://remote-dog-face-123.deno.dev/
    - If not hosted anymore, deploy the content of ⁠ /web_deployed_face.zip ⁠ yourself
    (Recommended services: Deno Deploy or Netlify)
2.⁠ ⁠Start the controller app:
    
    
⁠     deno --allow-net --allow-read main.ts
    
     ⁠
    
3.⁠ ⁠Access the interface at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

The keyboard controls are displayed in the interface. Enjoy!
